For such a visual tutorial, it would be better to lead chapters with an image of what we are going to build.
Add more ticks `` to reference actual code words, and bolding for jargon
Add more [info], [action], [challenge], [solution] blockquotes
This basically adds all the HTML then all the CSS each chapter. Students will not learn much I think unless it is broken out peice by peice more.

- P00-Making A Plan
  - Add Learning Objectives
  - Add what you need to know before you start
- P01-Navigation
  - Need to break down more the CSS and say what each style does
  -

Careful with unescaped <html tags> => `<html tags>`
